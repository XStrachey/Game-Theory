This repository contains a collection of scripts developed as part of my coursework for **ECO 395K: Game Theory**, offered by the Department of Economics at the University of Texas at Austin in Spring 2025.

Some scripts illustrate key theoretical results, while others provide computational tools for solving and visualizing game-theoretic models. These materials aim to deepen understanding of strategic reasoning in economic environments and may be useful for students, researchers, or practitioners interested in applied game theory.

All content is shared for academic purposes. If you find this repository helpful, a citation or acknowledgment would be sincerely appreciated.

For any questions or collaboration inquiries, feel free to contact me. I'm also open to research-related opportunities.
